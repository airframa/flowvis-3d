# flowvis-3d
Repository intended to perform the processing of an input point cloud containing Flow-Vis paint 3D data 

## Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.10.11 or higher installed.
- Install Poetry. [See Poetry's documentation for installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/airframa/flowvis-3d.git
   cd flowvis-3d
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   - Configure Poetry to create the virtual environment within the project directory:

     ```sh
     poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
     ```

   - Then, install dependencies with Poetry:

     ```sh
     poetry install
     ```

   This creates a `.venv` directory inside your project and installs all dependencies.

3. **Select Python Interpreter**

   After installing the dependencies, set the Python interpreter to the one recommended by the virtual environment. On VS code:

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.
   - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and press Enter.
   - Choose the recommended interpreter which should correspond to the virtual environment you've created, typically `.venv: poetry`.


### Running the Application

- **Activate the virtual environment:**

  - **Windows:**
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **Unix/MacOS:**
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

- **Start the application by running on the terminal:** `python app_launch.py`


ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: Application currently under development. Further functionalities will be added soon.
